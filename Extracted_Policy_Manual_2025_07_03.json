Application\n\nThese Procedures apply to grievances alleging discrimination based on race, color, religion, disability, national origin, veteran's status, genetic code, or political affiliation. Grievances alleging discrimination based on sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity) or pregnancy and parenting should be filed using the District's Title IX Procedure.\n\nExamples of discrimination include but are not limited to harassment based on a person's membership in a protected class, limiting or denying a person opportunities, privileges, or advantages based on membership in a protected class and otherwise treating any person differently based on that person's membership in a protected class.\n\nDisability discrimination may also include denying a student with a disability a free appropriate public education and failing to make modifications of policies, practices, or procedures when such modification is necessary to accommodate individuals with disabilities.\n\nReligious discrimination may also include penalizing a student for coursework based on religious content or religious viewpoint, denying a student the right to engage in religious activities or expression to the same extent students may engage in nonreligious activities or expression, denying a student the right to wear religious clothing or symbols.\n\nThe District prohibits retaliation against anyone who files a grievance or cooperates in the investigation of a grievance.\n\nC.

The grievance must state the problem or action alleged to be discriminatory and the remedy or relief sought.\n\nIf the complainant is unable to put the grievance in writing, the District shall provide reasonable accommodations to assist the complainant with submission of a grievance.

This investigation may be informal, but it must be thorough, affording the student(s) and parent(s)/ legal guardian(s) an opportunity to submit evidence relevant to the grievance, including the opportunity to present witnesses.\n\nThe Superintendent will designate an alternative investigator if the Compliance Officer has a conflict of interest with the investigation. If the Superintendent is the one alleged to have unlawfully discriminated, the grievance shall be filed with the President of the Board, who will then designate a Compliance Officer to conduct the investigation.\n\nBased on the recommendation of the Compliance Officer, the District may take temporary action to ensure that students have equal educational opportunities during the investigation.\n\nDecision\n\nThe Compliance Officer will complete the investigation and issue a written decision on the grievance no later than thirty (30) days after its filing unless extenuating circumstances require an extension of the thirty (30) day timeline.

    "content": "The District is committed to providing a workplace free from discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity & Anti-Discrimination\n\nThe District is an equal opportunity employer and complies with all applicable federal, state, and local laws regarding equal employment opportunity and anti-discrimination. The District strictly prohibits and does not tolerate discrimination against employees, applicants, or any other covered persons because of race, color, religion, creed, national origin or ancestry, ethnicity, sex (including gender, pregnancy, sexual orientation, and gender identity), age, physical or mental disability, citizenship, past, current, or prospective service in the uniformed services, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected under applicable federal, state, or local law. All District employees, representatives, and other covered persons are prohibited from engaging in unlawful discrimination. This Policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including, but not limited to, hiring, training, promotion, discipline, compensation, benefits, and termination of employment.\n\nIn addition, the District complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and all applicable state or local law. Consistent with those requirements, the District will reasonably accommodate qualified individuals with a disability if such accommodation would allow the individual to perform the essential functions of the job, unless doing so would create an undue hardship. Requests for accommodation should be submitted to the Human Resources Department. The District will also, where appropriate, provide reasonable accommodations for an employee's religious beliefs or practices so long as the accommodation does not impose an undue hardship on the District.\n\nHarassment\n\nHarassment is: (1) unwelcome conduct; (2) based on race, color, religion, creed, national origin or ancestry, ethnicity, sex (including gender, pregnancy, sexual orientation, and gender identity), age, physical or mental disability, citizenship, past, current, or prospective service in the uniformed services, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected under applicable federal, state, or local law; and (3)(a) that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms of employment and create an abusive work environment; or (b) that results in a tangible employment action (such as termination, demotion, or change in compensation).\n\nThe District strictly prohibits and does not tolerate unlawful harassment against employees or any other covered persons. Harassment is prohibited at the workplace and at employer-sponsored events.\n\nSexual Harassment\n\nAll District employees and representatives are prohibited from harassing employees and other covered persons based on that individual's sex or gender (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity) and regardless of the harasser's sex or gender.\n\nSexual harassment means any harassment based on someone's sex or gender. It includes harassment that is not sexual in nature (for example, offensive remarks about an individual's sex or gender), as well as any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any other conduct of a sexual nature, when any of the following is true:\n\nThe District will not tolerate any form of sexual harassment, regardless of whether it is:\n\nIn addition to the sexual harassment described above, Title IX sexual harassment is a subset of sexual harassment. Generally, Title IX sexual harassment is conduct, based on sex that constitutes one or more of the following:\n\n(a) Unwelcome conduct, occurring in the United States, that a reasonable person would find so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to a District-sponsored education program or activity;\n\n(b) An employee conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the District on an individual's participation in unwelcome sexual conduct; or\n\n(c) Any of the following specific acts of sexual harassment taking place within the United States and within a District-sponsored program or activity: sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking.\n\nSexual harassment is prohibited both at the workplace and at District-sponsored events. Depending on the circumstances of the complaint, allegations of sexual harassment may be subject to concurrent investigations under this Policy and the District's applicable Title IX Policy and Procedures.\n\nReporting an Incident of Harassment, Discrimination or Retaliation\n\nThe District encourages reporting of all perceived incidents that violate this Policy regardless of the alleged offender's identity or position and including vendors or others with whom the District does business.\n\nConduct that violates this Policy should be promptly reported to the Superintendent or the District's human resources department. The District encourages those filing a complaint to do so as soon as possible after the offending conduct. As necessary, the District will conduct a prompt investigation, either formal or informal, into the complaint. Individuals are encouraged to use the District's complaint form, which is available on the District's website at www.aguafria.org, or may be requested from the Title IX Coordinator or the Human Resources Department. While the complaint form is not mandatory to file a complaint, it assists the District in collecting the necessary information to move forward.\n\nA complaint should be as detailed as possible, including the names of all individuals involved and any witnesses. The District will directly and thoroughly investigate the facts and circumstances of all claims of perceived discrimination and will take prompt corrective action, if appropriate.\n\nAdditionally, any supervisor who observes discriminatory conduct must report the conduct to the District's human resources department so that a prompt investigation can be conducted, if necessary, and corrective action taken, if appropriate.\n\nNon-Retaliation\n\nThe District strictly prohibits and does not tolerate unlawful retaliation against any applicant, employee, or other covered person by any employee. All forms of unlawful retaliation are prohibited, including any form of discipline, reprisal, intimidation, or other form of retaliation for good faith reports or complaints of incidents of discrimination of any kind, pursuing any discrimination claim, or cooperating in related investigations.\n\nThe District is committed to enforcing this Policy against all forms of discrimination. However, the effectiveness of the District's efforts depends largely on employees informing the District about inappropriate workplace conduct. If employees feel that they or someone else may have been subjected to conduct that violates this Policy, the District encourages them to report it immediately. If employees do not report discriminatory conduct, the District may not become aware of a possible violation of this Policy and may not be able to take appropriate corrective action.\n\nViolations of this Policy\n\nAny employee, regardless of position or title, who violates this Policy may be subject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment.\n\nAdministration of this Policy\n\nThe District's Human Resources Department is responsible for the administration of this Policy. Questions regarding this Policy or questions about discrimination, accommodations, or retaliation that are not addressed in this Policy should be directed to the human resources department.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nDistrict employees who receive complaints alleging discrimination, harassment, or retaliation will maintain the confidentiality of the information they receive. However, District employees are permitted to disclose such information as required by law or when disclosure is necessary to facilitate legitimate District business, such as the investigation and resolution process.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1703\n\n29 U.S.C. § 206 et seq.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 794\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq."

    "content": "A. Definitions\n\n\"Complainant\" means the person filing a grievance.\n\n\"Compliance Officer\" means the District personnel responsible for receiving and investigating grievances alleging discrimination.\n\n\"Harassment\" is (1) unwelcome conduct; (2) based on race, color, religion, creed, national origin or ancestry, ethnicity, sex (including gender, pregnancy, sexual orientation, and gender identity), age, physical or mental disability, citizenship, past, current, or prospective service in the uniformed services, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected under applicable federal, state, or local law; and (3)(a) that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms of employment and create an abusive work environment; or (b) that results in a tangible employment action (such as termination, demotion, or change in compensation).\n\n\"Religious discrimination\" means any act of discrimination on the basis of religion in violation of Title IV or A.R.S. § 15-110.\n\n\"Title IX\" means Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.\n\nB. Application\n\nThese Procedures apply to grievances alleging discrimination and/or harassment based on race, color, religion, disability, age, national origin, veteran's status, genetic code, or political affiliation. These Procedures also apply to grievances alleging retaliation for good faith reports or complaints of incidents of discrimination or harassment of any kind, pursuing any discrimination or harassment claim, or cooperating in related investigations. Grievances alleging discrimination or harassment based on sex (including gender, pregnancy, sexual orientation or gender identity) should be filed using the District's Title IX Procedure. To the extent a complaint is filed alleging discrimination or harassment on the basis of sex and other conduct, the District may conduct simultaneous investigations under this Procedure and the District's Title IX Policy and Procedure.\n\nThe District also prohibits retaliation against anyone who files a grievance or cooperates in the investigation of a grievance.\n\nC. Compliance Officer\n\nThe District's Compliance Officers are as follows:\n\nSection 504/ADA Compliance Officer:\n\nPatrick Becker, Director of Special Education\n623-932-7000\n\nTamee Gressett, Executive Director of Student Services/District Athletics\n623-932-7000\n\nD. Grievance Process\n\nSubmittal of Grievance\n\nA grievance should be submitted to the Compliance Officer within thirty (30) days of the date the complainant becomes aware of the alleged violation of District Policy.\n\nA grievance should be in writing, containing the name and address of the person filing it. The grievance should also state the problem or action alleged to be discriminatory and the remedy or relief sought.\n\nIf the complainant is unable to or does not submit the grievance in writing, the District will provide reasonable accommodations to assist the complainant or otherwise meet with the complainant for the submission of their grievance. Although the District encourages individuals to submit grievances in writing, the District will nonetheless provide prompt and equitable response when it becomes aware of violations of District Policy.\n\nThe Compliance Officer will strive to confirm receipt of the grievance within five (5) working days following receipt.\n\nInvestigation\n\nThe Compliance Officer, or designee, shall conduct an investigation of the grievance. This investigation may be informal, but it must be thorough, affording all interested persons an opportunity to submit evidence relevant to the grievance, including the opportunity to present witnesses.\n\nThe Superintendent or human resources officer will designate an alternate investigator if the Compliance Officer has a conflict of interest with the investigation.\n\nBased on the recommendation of the Compliance Officer, or designee, the District may take temporary action during the investigation to ensure equal employment opportunity and prevent retaliation.\n\nDecision\n\nThe Compliance Officer will strive to complete the investigation and issue a written decision on the grievance no later than thirty (30) days after its filing unless extenuating circumstances require an extension of the thirty (30) day timeline. In such a case, the Compliance Officer, or designee, will communicate with the complainant concerning the need for an extension.\n\nAppeal\n\nThe complainant or respondent may appeal the decision of the Compliance Officer by writing to the Superintendent or human resources officer, within fifteen (15) days of receiving the Compliance Officer's decision. The [Superintendent or human resources officer], or designee, will strive to issue a written decision in response to the appeal within thirty (30) days of receipt of the appeal.\n\nRemedial or Other Action\n\nIf it is determined that discrimination occurred, the District shall take the appropriate steps to prevent the recurrence of discrimination and correct the discriminatory effects on the complainant and others. If disciplinary action is appropriate, teachers, administrators, other personnel, and students will be afforded all respective rights afforded by the law and District Policy, and disciplinary action will follow all applicable policies and procedures.\n\nGeneral"

    "content": "Definitions\n\nThe following definition of sexual harassment has been established by the Title IX regulations and implemented by the District regarding this Policy.\n\n\"Sexual harassment\" means conduct based on sex that satisfies one or more of the following:\n\n\"Complainant\" means any person who is participating in or attempting to participate in the District's education or employment programs and/or activities and who is alleged to be the victim of conduct that could constitute sexual harassment.\n\n\"Respondent\" means a person who has been reported to be the perpetrator of conduct that could constitute sexual harassment.\n\n\"Party/Parties\" means all complainant(s) and respondent(s) involved in a formal complaint; formal complaints may involve multiple complainants and/or respondents.\n\n\"Formal complaint\" means a document filed by a complainant or one that is signed by the Title IX Coordinator alleging sexual harassment against a respondent and requesting that the District investigate the allegation of sexual harassment.\n\n\"Actual knowledge\" means notice of sexual harassment or allegations of sexual harassment to the District's Title IX Coordinator or any official of the District who has the authority to institute corrective measures on behalf of the District, or to any employee of the District.\n\n\"Consent\" is informed, freely and affirmatively given through mutually understandable words or actions that indicate a willingness to participate in the sexual activity. Consent can be withdrawn at any time. There is no consent when there is force, expressed or implied, or when coercion, intimidation, threats, or duress is used. Whether a person has taken advantage of a position of influence over another person may be a factor in determining consent. Silence or absence of resistance does not imply consent. Consent to one type of sexual activity does not amount to consent to another type of activity. Prior consent or sexual relations with the same person do not imply future consent. The fact that both people are in a relationship does not, by itself, establish consent. A person cannot consent if they are unconscious, asleep, or impaired to the extent that they do not understand what is going on. Minors under the age of 16 are incapable of giving consent to sexual activity with a person more than four years older than the minor. Consent may never be given by mentally disabled persons if their disability was reasonably knowable to a sexual partner who is not mentally disabled. Consent between parties engaging in sexual activity does not prevent the school system from taking disciplinary action against the parties for violation of any other board Policy.\n\n\"Fondling\" means the touching of a person's genitalia, anus, buttocks, or breasts without the consent of the victim for purposes of sexual gratification.\n\n\"Program or activity\" means any location, events, or circumstances over which the District exhibits substantial control over both the alleged harasser and the context in which the harassment occurred.\n\n\"Supportive measures\" means non-disciplinary, non-punitive, individualized services offered as appropriate and as reasonably available, and without fee or charge to a complainant or respondent before or after the filing of a formal complaint or where no formal complaint has been filed, which are designed to restore or preserve equal access to education or employment programs and/or activities without unreasonably burdening the other party, including measures designed to protect the safety of parties or the educational/work environment or to deter sexual harassment.\n\nPurpose of Title IX\n\nTitle IX of the Federal Education Amendments Act protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs, or activities that receive Federal financial assistance. The District does not discriminate based on sex and adheres to all conditions established by Title IX by recognizing the right of every staff member and student who attends the District to do so without the fear of sexual harassment.\n\nThe District is obligated to identify an employee to serve as the Title IX Coordinator and authorize that individual to coordinate and facilitate the District's compliance efforts regarding its responsibilities under Title IX, including inquiries about the application of Title IX or formal complaints. The District's Title IX Coordinator is:\n\nNotices\n\nThe contact information for the Title IX Coordinator, and the District's nondiscrimination notice will be prominently posted on the District's website and in any student, or employee handbooks.\n\nAny documents used to train the Title IX Coordinator, investigators, decision makers, and others involved in the grievance process will be posted on the District's website. In addition, the District will notify students, parent(s)/legal guardian(s) of students, employees, applicants for admission and employment, and unions, or similar employee professional organizations that have an agreement with the District (if applicable) of this Policy and the grievance procedures included in this Policy, including how to report sexual harassment and how the District will respond to such reports. The required notification may be accomplished in any way that the District deems appropriate and effective.\n\nReporting\n\nAny person may report sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, regardless of whether the person reporting is the person alleged to be the victim of the reported conduct or not. A report may be made in person, by mail, by telephone, or by electronic mail, using the contact information listed for the Title IX Coordinator, or by any other means that results in the Title IX Coordinator receiving the person's verbal or written report. Complaints of sex discrimination that are not sexual harassment will be handled pursuant to the District's regular procedures for resolving student or employee grievances promptly and equitably. Formal complaints of sexual harassment will be handled using the grievance procedure set forth in this Policy.\n\nSupportive Services\n\nThe District is committed to offering supportive services to every complainant regardless of whether a formal complaint is submitted, to investigating each formal complaint submitted and to taking appropriate action on all confirmed violations of Policy. Supportive measures may include, but are not limited to counseling, class modifications or class schedule changes, and/or increased monitoring and supervision, as deemed appropriate by the Title IX Coordinator.\n\nAllegations of Sexual Harassment\n\nUpon receiving notification of alleged sexual harassment, the Title IX Coordinator shall promptly and confidentially contact the complainant to discuss the availability of supportive measures, consider the complainant's wishes with respect to supportive measures, inform the complainant of the availability of supportive measures with or without the filing of a formal complaint, and explain the process for filing a formal complaint, if applicable.\n\nThe Title IX Coordinator shall offer supportive measures to the complainant, either before or after the filing of a formal complaint or following a report where no complaint has been filed.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1681, Education Amendments of 1972, Title IX"

    "content": "A. Grievance Process Generally\n\nThe District shall follow grievance procedures that provide for the prompt and equitable resolution of formal complaints from students and employees alleging sexual harassment.\n\nThe investigator, decision maker and appeal officer involved in the investigation of a formal complaint shall not be the same person. Although the Title IX Coordinator may also be the investigator, the Title IX Coordinator shall not serve as the decision maker or appeal officer in any investigation.\n\nIf any person involved in an investigation has a concern that the designated investigator, decision-maker, or appeal officer may have a bias or conflict of interest, or for any other reason, the Title IX Coordinator will evaluate the situation and determine in their sole discretion whether to designate a different internal investigator, decision-maker, or appeal officer. In their sole discretion, the Title IX Coordinator may choose to retain an outside investigator, decision-maker, or appeal officer.\n\nPrior to a determination of responsibility for the conduct alleged, the District may remove a student who is a respondent from the District's educational program or activity on an emergency basis, only when such removal is necessary to protect the student or another individual from an immediate threat to physical health or safety. If a student has an IEP or a Section 504 plan, the decision to remove the student on an emergency basis must be coordinated with the District's special education or section 504 staff and in compliance with relevant IDEA or Section 504 requirements.\n\nThe District may place an employee who is a respondent on administrative leave while allegations are investigated and resolved in accordance with this Policy.\n\nThe District will attempt to complete the grievance process within sixty (60) District working days, not including any time for an appeal of the Determination of Responsibility. The grievance process may be temporarily delayed and/or timelines may be extended for good cause with written notice to the parties explaining the reason(s) for the delay or extension.\n\nB. Grievance Process for Formal Complaints\n\nA complainant may file a formal complaint by submitting the complaint in person, by mail, by telephone, or by e-mail to the Title IX Coordinator or designee. If a verbal report of sexual harassment is made, the complainant will be asked to submit a written complaint. If a complainant refuses or is unable to submit a written complaint, the Compliance Coordinator or other District employee to whom the report was made will summarize the verbal complaint in writing and sign the summary.\n\nIf a complainant does not file a formal complaint, the Title IX Coordinator in their sole discretion, may sign a formal complaint and initiate the grievance process. The decision to initiate the grievance process over the wishes of the complainant should not be clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances. The Title IX Coordinator should document the reasons for signing or not signing a formal complaint including why the decision was not deliberately indifferent.\n\nA complaint should be filed immediately after alleged sexual harassment occurs and as soon as possible to ensure the best possible investigation. Delay in filing can result in an impaired investigation due to lack of sufficient evidence and a compromised ability to rely on recollections of parties and witnesses.\n\nFollowing the filing of a formal complaint, the Title IX Coordinator will provide written notice to the complainant and the respondent of the allegations of the formal complaint and the grievance process, including any informal resolution process. The notice of the allegations must include:\n\nIf additional allegations arise during an investigation and will be investigated, the Title IX Coordinator or investigator will provide written notice of those additional allegations to both the complainant and respondent.\n\nC. Duty to Report Child Abuse/Law Enforcement Investigation\n\nTitle IX sexual harassment complaints may include violations addressed in A.R.S. § 13-3620, Duty to report abuse, physical injury, neglect and denial or deprivation of medical or surgical care or nourishment of minors; medical records; exception; violation; classification; definitions. Any abuses classified by statute as \"reportable offenses\" must be reported as such to local law enforcement authorities or Department of Child Safety, as not reporting a reportable offense is classified as a Class 6 Felony.\n\nWhen the Title IX Coordinator, investigator, decision-maker, or appeal officer reasonably believe that a law enforcement investigation will commence in regard to the sexual harassment reported to the District, they reserve the right to temporarily suspend the grievance process and investigative efforts, but will continue supportive measures as appropriate; unless in conjunction with the law enforcement authorities it is determined that continuation of the internal investigation during a pending law enforcement investigation is permissible and necessary. If the investigation has been delayed due to a law enforcement investigation, as soon as the District becomes aware that the law enforcement investigation has concluded, the grievance process will resume. A finding by law enforcement that no wrongdoing occurred will not determine the outcome of the District's investigation but will be considered along with the other evidence.\n\nD. Informal Resolution\n\nAfter a formal complaint has been filed and at any time during the grievance process before a determination is reached, allegations may be resolved informally only if a formal complaint is filed and only if the complaint does not allege that a District employee harassed a student.\n\nAs part of the informal resolution process, the Title IX Coordinator may engage in interviews and other fact finding. Available methods of informal resolution include arbitration, mediation, and restorative justice procedures. Once an informal resolution is agreed to by the parties, it becomes binding. The Title IX Coordinator has the discretion to decline informal resolution for some complaints, including complaints of sexual violence, and instead require a formal investigation.\n\nBoth parties to a formal complaint must voluntarily agree in writing to participate in an informal resolution process. No party is ever required to participate in an informal resolution process and intimidation, threats, and coercion are expressly prohibited. Informal resolution will proceed pursuant to the procedures set out below.\n\nThe District adopts a mediation approach to informal resolution. Efforts to resolve the formal complaint via informal resolution should not extend longer than ten (10) school days unless for good cause (such as unavailability of the parties, state-wide testing, etc.). If the informal resolution process takes more than ten (10) school days for good cause, the Title IX Coordinator may send a Notice of Temporary Delay for Good Cause if it appears that the District will not be able to meet its deadline to complete the Title IX grievance process.\n\nEither party may withdraw from an informal resolution at any time before agreeing to a resolution and resume the grievance process. Once an informal resolution is agreed to by the parties, it becomes binding.\n\nE. Procedures for Informal Resolution\n\nAfter receipt of a formal complaint of sexual harassment pursuant to the District's Title IX Policy, the Title IX Coordinator will determine whether the complaint is appropriate for referral to informal resolution. The Title IX Coordinator may consider the complainant's wishes in making this determination. If the Title IX Coordinator determines that the formal complaint is appropriate for informal resolution, he/she will send both parties an Invitation to Participate in Informal Resolution Process letter.\n\nIf both parties return the Consent to Participate forms, the Title IX Coordinator or designee will initiate the informal resolution process within five (5) school days of receipt of both signed Consent to Participate forms. The Title IX Coordinator will designate an Informal Resolution Facilitator. Even if the parties do not agree to participate in informal resolution at the outset of the grievance process, the parties may agree to participate in informal resolution at any point in the grievance process prior to the issuance of a determination of responsibility letter by the decision-maker.\n\nInformal resolution facilitator (\"facilitator\"): this individual may be the Title IX Coordinator or another individual who has been trained on the District's Title IX Policy and procedures, is free from conflicts of interest and bias, and has been trained to serve impartially without prejudging the facts at issue. The facilitator will be responsible for contacting the parties within five (5) school days of receipt of the signed Consent to Participate forms to initiate the informal resolution process.\n\nThe facilitator will contact the complainant and the respondent, separately, to discuss the following:\n\nAfter communicating with both parties, the facilitator will determine whether to schedule a face-to-face meeting or to engage in \"shuttle diplomacy\" by discussing with each party separately the terms for agreement proposed by the other party. In making this determination, the facilitator should give primary deference to the wishes of the complainant regarding whether s/he wishes to meet face-to-face with the respondent but should also consider whether a face-to-face meeting is likely to be emotionally difficult for either party or ineffective in working toward resolution.\n\nF. Resolution Agreement\n\nIf the parties agree to resolve the formal complaint without proceeding through investigation and a final determination, the terms of that agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties. A non-exhaustive list of examples of terms that may be included in an informal resolution agreement are as follows:\n\nThe District is not a party to the resolution agreement; however, the Facilitator should confirm the feasibility of any terms to which the parties have agreed that implicate an administrative action by the District prior to the finalization and signing of a resolution agreement. Once an agreement is finalized, the District will take reasonable steps to ensure that it can be implemented on school property and at school-sponsored events.\n\nG. Confidentiality of the Informal Resolution Process\n\nInformation or evidence exchanged during an informal resolution process is not confidential as to the Title IX grievance process if a resolution agreement cannot be reached. Either party may share information or evidence obtained during the informal resolution process with the investigator. However, the Facilitator may not be a witness during investigation and the Facilitator's notes will not be shared with the parties and will not become part of the investigation file.\n\nAn informal resolution agreement itself will not be a confidential document as to disclosures by the District pursuant to a public records request, a subpoena for records, or data request from an enforcement agency such as the Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nH. Summary Dismissal\n\nIf the Title IX Coordinator or investigator determines that the allegations in a formal complaint, with all facts assumed to be true for this purpose, do not meet the definition of \"sexual harassment\" under the applicable Title IX regulations, did not occur in the District's educational program or activity, or did not occur against a person in the United States, the Title IX Coordinator or investigator shall summarily dismiss the formal complaint. The Title IX Coordinator or investigator may dismiss a formal complaint if the complainant requests withdrawal of the complaint, the respondent withdraws from the District or terminates their employment with the District, or specific circumstances prevent the District from gathering appropriate evidence to make a determination regarding the allegations.\n\nUpon dismissal of a formal complaint or any allegations contained in a formal complaint, the Title IX Coordinator will promptly and simultaneously provide written notice of the dismissal and the reason(s) for the dismissal to the complainant and respondent. If a complaint is summarily dismissed, the District may nevertheless take whatever additional disciplinary action it deems appropriate against the respondent under its student code of conduct, employee handbook or relevant policies and procedures.\n\nI. Investigation\n\nThe investigation will be premised on a presumption that the respondent is not responsible for the alleged act(s) of sexual harassment, and both parties will be treated equitably during the investigation. The burden of proof is on the District to prove a violation of this Policy by a preponderance of the evidence, which means that it is more likely than not that the respondent engaged in the prohibited behavior.\n\nThis Policy prohibits the complainant, the respondent, and any witnesses from knowingly making a false statement or providing false evidence in connection with a Title IX investigation. The District may take disciplinary action under the student code of conduct or employee handbook against individuals who make such false statements.\n\nBoth the complainant and the respondent will have a reasonable opportunity to present witnesses and other evidence to the investigator. The investigator will meet with each party and give them at least 24 hours' advance written notice of the date, time, location, and purpose of any interview that will be conducted. The District will not restrict the ability of either party to discuss the allegations and gather evidence related to the allegations of the formal complaint.\n\nThe designated investigator will interview the complainant, the respondent, any witnesses identified by either party, and review relevant records. In no event will a party be subjected to any disciplinary sanctions or consequences for refusing or failing to participate.\n\nBefore the investigator prepares the final investigation report, the complainant, the respondent, and their advisors (if any) will be provided with an equal opportunity to review all evidence that is directly related to the allegations in the formal complaint, including any evidence that the investigator does not intend to rely upon, and any exculpatory or inculpatory evidence from any source. If possible, the evidence will be provided to the parties in an electronic format and manner that does not permit copying or downloading of the evidence.\n\nWithin ten (10) calendar days of the date on which they were provided with access to the evidence, the parties may prepare and submit to the investigator a written response to the evidence, which the investigator must consider before preparing a final, written investigation report. Following the expiration of the date on which the parties may provide responses to the evidence, the investigator will promptly prepare and issue a written investigation report that fairly summarizes the relevant evidence discovered during the investigation, but no determination of responsibility will be made by the investigator.\n\nJ. Determination of Responsibility\n\nThe written investigation report and any responses submitted by the complainant and/or respondent will be provided to the District's assigned Decision Maker, who will make the determination regarding responsibility. The Decision Maker will provide each party with an opportunity to submit written, relevant questions for any party or witness within five (5) calendar days of the date on which the Decision Maker is provided with a copy of the final written investigation report and any responses to the report.\n\nIf written questions are submitted, the Decision Maker will promptly provide the questions to the appropriate individual so the individual can provide answers to the questions. Answers to the questions must be provided to the Decision Maker within five (5) calendar days of the date on which they are provided. The Decision Maker will promptly provide each party with the answers to the questions and allow for additional, limited follow-up questions in writing from both the complainant and respondent within three (3) calendar days. If written follow-up questions are submitted to the Decision Maker, the Decision Maker will promptly obtain the answers and provide both parties with the responses to the additional questions. Any questions regarding a complainant's prior sexual behavior or sexual predisposition will be deemed irrelevant unless they are offered to provide evidence that someone other than the respondent committed the alleged misconduct or are offered to prove consent.\n\nNo sooner than ten (10) calendar days after receiving the investigation report, the Decision Maker will issue a written determination of responsibility (the \"Determination\") that includes:\n\nThe deadline for the Decision Maker to issue the Determination may be extended for good cause at the Decision Maker's sole discretion. The Determination must be based upon a preponderance of the evidence (i.e., whether it is more likely than not that the violation occurred). The complainant and the respondent will be notified concurrently of the Determination.\n\nStudents found to have violated Title IX will be referred for potential disciplinary action. Employees found to have violated Title IX will be subject to employment actions, including but not limited to discipline or termination of employment.\n\nK. Appeals\n\nEither the complainant or the respondent may appeal from: (a) the Determination regarding a formal complaint; (b) the District's handling of a report; or (c) the dismissal of a formal complaint, by submitting a written notice of appeal that includes the bases of the appeal to the Decision Maker within ten (10) calendar days of the date of the Determination. No hearing will be held for an appeal.\n\nWritten notice of the appeal will be provided to both parties. Either party may file a written response in support of or challenging the Determination and the bases for the appeal within five (5) calendar days of the date on which written notice of the appeal was provided to all parties.\n\nAn appeal may be filed on the following bases only:\n\nThe Parties will simultaneously be provided with a written decision regarding the appeal, which will describe the result of the appeal and the rationale for the decision.\n\nL. Confidentiality and Retention of Investigation Information and Records\n\nExcept as necessary to complete a thorough and effective investigation and grievance process under this Policy and as required by law or District Policy, the identity of complainants, respondents, and witnesses, information related to investigations, evidence gathered, and records created during investigations will be maintained in strict confidence.\n\nIn implementing this Policy, the District will comply with state and federal laws regarding the confidentiality of student and employee records. Information and records regarding any disciplinary sanctions imposed on an employee or student will be maintained and disclosed in the same manner as any other disciplinary record.\n\nThe Title IX Coordinator will retain investigation files for a time period of no less than seven (7) years, and investigation determination notices will be permanently retained in individual employee and student files.\n\nThe records maintained by the District will document that the District's response to allegations of sexual harassment was not deliberately indifferent and that measures were taken to restore or preserve equal access to the District's educational program or activity. If the District did not offer supportive measures in response to a report made under this Policy, the District's records will document why that response was not deliberately indifferent and not clearly unreasonable under the circumstances known at the time.\n\nM. Training\n\nThe District will provide annual training to employees on identifying and reporting acts that may constitute discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. The Title IX Coordinator, designated investigators, designated decision-makers, designated appeal officer, and any District employees who are designated to facilitate informal resolution processes, will receive additional training on this Policy and implementation of the grievance process at least as often as required by the Title IX Regulations."

Overtime work shall not be encouraged or performed unless absolutely necessary.\n\nBefore an employee undertakes an overtime assignment, the employee must have the prior written authorization of his or her immediate supervisor. Except in actual emergencies that threaten health, safety, or property, the supervisor, building principal, or other person requesting the overtime also must obtain approval for the overtime from the Human Resources Department before the work is performed.\n\nB. Work Week Designation\n\nEach work week will be from 12:00 a.m. Sunday until 11:59 p.m. Saturday.\n\nC. Nonapplicability to Exempt Employees\n\nThis procedure does not apply to employees who are exempt from coverage under the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n\nD. Overtime Compensation\n\nIf the District requests that a non-exempt employee covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) (FLSA) work beyond a forty (40) hour workweek, the employee shall be entitled to overtime compensation as follows:\n\nFor each hour worked over forty (40) in any workweek, the employee shall be entitled to compensatory time off at the rate of one and one-half (1½) hours for each hour of overtime worked.\n\nEmployees may not accrue more than thirty (30) hours of compensatory time off (20 hours of actual overtime worked). Any employee who accrues thirty (30) hours of compensatory time off shall be paid overtime compensation for any additional overtime if it is not reasonably possible for the employee to take compensatory time off. Compensatory time must be used within the school calendar semester when it is accrued.\n\nAn employee who has accrued compensatory time off should direct any request for the use of that time to his or her supervisor. Requested time off shall be made available on a case-by-case basis and will not be granted if, in the opinion of the employee's supervisor, the request would unduly disrupt the District's operations.\n\nAccrued compensatory time off does not carry over from year to year and must be used before January 1 or July 1 of each year (within the semester it is accrued). If it is not practicable for the employee to use his or her accrued time off by June 30 or December 31, the employee shall be paid overtime compensation in lieu of the accrued compensatory time off.\n\nIf the employee leaves the District before using his or her compensatory time off, the employee shall be compensated at one and one-half (1½) times the rate the employee was earning when the overtime was worked.\n\nIn determining eligibility for overtime compensation or compensatory time, compensatory or other time taken during any workweek shall not be counted as hours worked during that work week.\n\nOvertime compensation shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half (1½) times the employee's regular hourly rate for each hour worked over forty (40) in the workweek for which the employee works overtime."

Competitive procurement is required for every expenditure of public monies in excess of the limits specified in A.R.S. § 41-2535.\n\nGoverning Board Approval\n\nThe Governing Board shall approve all procurements of One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000.00) or more. The Board delegates authority to the Superintendent to approve all procurements under the $150,000.00 threshold.\n\nDelegation of Procurement Authority\n\nPursuant to Arizona Administrative Code R7-2-1007, the Board delegates procurement authority to the Superintendent, who shall serve as the District representative in procurement matters.

Board members and District employees may accept gifts or benefits of nominal value from a vendor as permitted by statute.\n\nPurchase from District Employees or Board Members\n\nThe District must use competitive bidding when purchasing any equipment, material, supplies, or services from District employees regardless of dollar amount. This applies to any purchase using District monies, including extracurricular activities fees tax credit, student activities monies, gifts and/or donations.\n\nThe Board authorizes purchases from Board members as authorized pursuant to A.R.S. § 15-323.

    "content": "The District shall comply with all requisite procurement laws and regulations, including but not limited to the State Board of Education's procurement code for school districts (School Procurement Code) in Ariz. Admin. Code R7-2-1001 et seq.\n\nWhen determining the level of competitive purchasing required (i.e., written quotes, sealed bids or proposals), the District shall consider not only the dollar amount of the current purchase, but the total dollar amount of all like-item purchases that might occur during the fiscal year. If the amount of the good or service that will be needed during the year is uncertain, the District should analyze cumulative purchases of like items for the previous fiscal year and adjust the estimate for any changes (e.g., increased enrollment, new school) that might affect the amount of the good or service needed.\n\nThe Superintendent may delegate the Superintendent's procurement authority in a manner that is compliant with Ariz. Admin. Code R7-2-1007.\n\nPurchases of less than $10,000 may be made at the discretion of the Superintendent. Such procurements are not subject to competitive purchasing requirements, however reasonable judgment should be used to ensure the purchases are advantageous to the District.\n\nWritten price quotations will be requested from at least three (3) vendors for transactions of at least $10,000 but not more than $100,000 or the threshold as specified in A.R.S. § 41-2535 and Uniform System of Financial Records (USFR) § VI-G. A request for quotations should be issued in sufficient time before the purchase is to be made and in adequate detail to allow vendors to respond effectively. If three (3) written price quotations cannot be obtained, documentation showing that the vendors contacted did not offer written price quotations, or explaining why written price quotations were not obtained, shall be maintained in the procurement file.\n\nSealed bids and proposals shall be requested for transactions to purchase construction, materials, or services costing more than $100,000. The District may use an alternative form of procurement as authorized.\n\nThe District shall maintain a prospective bidders' list. Vendors desiring to be included on the District's prospective bidders' list must notify the District. If the District's prospective bidders' list has four (4) or fewer prospective bidders on the list, the District shall publish notices of the invitation for bids or request for proposals in the official newspaper of the County in addition to issuing an invitation for bids or request for proposals to vendors on the bidders' list.\n\nIn lieu of obtaining quotations or conducting a competitive procurement, the District may purchase materials, services, specified professional services, construction, or construction services with one or more public procurement units pursuant to a cooperative purchasing agreement approved by the Governing Board.\n\nPrior to making a purchase under a cooperative purchasing agreement, the District shall perform due diligence to ensure that the cooperative purchase is in compliance with the School Procurement Code.\n\nPrior to making a purchase through a cooperative purchasing agreement of $100,000 or more, the District representative shall document the reasons that a cooperative purchasing agreement is advantageous to the District. All purchases made from a cooperative purchasing agreement costing more than $150,000 shall be approved by the Board.\n\nAn exception to the requisite procedures for price competition may be made in the event of an emergency involving the health, safety, or welfare of school personnel or students. In such an emergency, declared by the Superintendent, emergency purchase action may be taken without price competition, if necessary. Even under emergency conditions, price competition should be sought if it will not unacceptably delay the correction of the condition requiring emergency procedures. If emergency purchases are made without price competition, a complete written description of the circumstances should be maintained in the procurement file.\n\nA contract may be awarded for a material, service, or construction item without competition if the Board determines that there is only one (1) source for the required material, service, or construction item. The District may require the submission of cost or pricing data in connection with an award pursuant to Ariz. Admin. Code R7-2-1053. Sole-source procurement shall be avoided, except when no reasonable alternative source exists. A copy of the written evidence and determination of the basis for the sole-source procurement shall be retained in the procurement file by the District.\n\nThe District shall, to the extent practicable, negotiate with the single supplier a contract advantageous to the District.\n\nThe Governing Board authorizes the use of alternative forms of procurement for construction other than competitive sealed bids, including requests for proposals, construction-manager-at-risk, design-build, and job-order contracting methods of construction.\n\nThe District may procure goods, services and equipment via electronic, on-line bidding or use reverse auctions as permitted and documented in the School Procurement Code.\n\nIn determining the method of source selection based upon the aggregate dollar amount of a purchase, the District shall consider the scope and total cost of the entire purchase. Procurement requirements shall not be artificially divided or fragmented so as to circumvent the source selection procedures required by the School Procurement Code.\n\nThe District may enter into purchasing contracts for a period of up to five (5) years if the District determines in writing as follows:\n\nThe District shall make available for inspection all procurement files upon request of a vendor or as otherwise required.\n\nDocumentation provided will include information regarding the most advantageous, with respect to price, conformity to the specifications, conflict of interest declarations and other factors, or whose proposal for qualifications are to be used to select and award the bid. The District will include in the procurement file the rationale for awarding a contract for any specified professional services, construction, construction service or materials to an entity selected from a qualified select bidders' list or through a school purchasing cooperative. The invitation for bids, request for proposals or request for qualifications shall include a notice that all information and bids, proposals and qualifications submitted will be made available for public inspection."

The offer and acceptance of a multiyear contract does not exclude that certificated teacher from the application of Arizona statutes as follows: A.R.S. § 15-538.01, A.R.S. § 15-540, A.R.S. § 15-541 or A.R.S. § 15-549.\n\n(b) The certificated teacher may accept a multiyear contract offer or decline and accept a one (1) year contract.\n\n(c) A certificated teacher in one of the two highest performance classifications who agrees to work at a school that is assigned a letter grade of D or F may receive incentives as adopted by the Board.\n\n(d) Protections for teachers who are assigned to schools that are assigned a letter grade of D or F, which may include allowing a second qualified evaluator to perform an observation or the evaluation of the certificated teacher's classroom performance.\n\n(e) Protections for teachers whose supervising principal has received a classification of ineffective, which may include allowing a second qualified evaluator to perform an observation or the evaluation of the certificated teacher's classroom performance.\n\nDefinition of Inadequate Classroom Performance\n\nThe Board's definition of inadequate classroom performance for a certificated teacher is as follows:\n\nEvaluation Procedures for Certificated Teacher\n\nThe District's performance evaluation system for certificated teachers shall include as follows:\n\n(a) The District shall require qualified evaluators to complete training.\n\n(b) A qualified evaluator shall conduct at least two actual classroom observations of the certificated teacher demonstrating teaching skills in a complete and uninterrupted lesson.\n\n(c) There shall be at least sixty (60) calendar days between the first and last observations.\n\n(d) The District may issue a preliminary notice of inadequate classroom performance based upon the first observation in a school year. The last observation may follow the issuance of a preliminary notice of inadequacy of classroom performance and be used to determine whether the teacher has corrected inadequacies and has demonstrated adequate classroom performance.\n\n(e) An observation shall not be conducted within two (2) instructional days of any scheduled period in which school is not in session for one week or more.\n\n(f) Within ten (10) business days after each observation, the qualified evaluator shall provide written feedback to the certificated teacher.\n\n(g) Summative annual evaluations shall be in writing or provided in an electronic format to the certificated teacher with a copy or access provided within five (5) calendar days after completion of the evaluation.\n\n(h) The certificated teacher may initiate a written reaction or response to the evaluation, which shall be kept with the evaluation.\n\n(i) The District shall include a plan for the use of quantitative data of student academic progress in evaluations of all certificated teachers. The plan may make distinctions between certificated teachers who provide direct instruction to students and certificated teachers who do not provide direct instruction to students. The plan may include data for multiple school years and may limit the use of data for certificated teachers who have taught for less than two (2) complete school years.\n\n(j) Each evaluation shall include recommendations as to areas of improvement in the performance of the certificated teacher if the performance of the teacher warrants improvement.\n\n(k) After transmittal of an evaluation, the qualified evaluator or designee shall confer with the certificated teacher to make specific recommendations as to areas of improvement in the teacher's performance.\n\n(l) The qualified evaluator or designee shall provide professional development opportunities for the certificated teacher to improve performance and follow up with the teacher after a reasonable period of time for the purpose of ascertaining that the teacher is demonstrating adequate performance.\n\n(m) The Board waives the requirement of a second classroom observation for a continuing teacher whose teaching performance based on the first classroom observation places the teacher in one of the two highest performance classifications for the current school year, unless the teacher requests a second observation.\n\nPreliminary Notice of Inadequate Classroom Performance and Performance Improvement Plan\n\nThe District may issue a preliminary notice of inadequate classroom performance and a corresponding performance improvement plan to any certificated teacher who has demonstrated inadequate classroom performance. The Board delegates responsibility to the Superintendent to issue any preliminary notice of inadequate classroom performance. The Superintendent shall provide notice to the Board of the issuance of a preliminary notice of inadequate classroom performance within ten (10) school days.\n\nUnder state law, the District must issue preliminary notices of inadequate classroom performance as follows:\n\n(a) To any certificated teacher who receives a performance classification of ineffective on an annual summative evaluation.\n\n(b) To any certificated teacher who is in the second consecutive year of receiving a performance classification of developing or ineffective, unless that certificated teacher is in the first or second year of employment with the District or has been reassigned to teach a new subject or grade level for the preceding or current school year.\n\nThe certificated teacher shall have forty-five (45) instructional days to improve the teacher's inadequate classroom performance. The improvement plan may provide recommendations regarding needed improvements, opportunities to confer with the qualified evaluator, and suggestions regarding professional development.\n\nProfessionalism Concerns\n\nIf there is reliable and substantial evidence that a certificated teacher's failure to meet the standards of the components of the evaluation instrument is deliberate (the result of the employee's choice), the employee's failure to meet components of the evaluation instrument that pertain to classroom performance may be deemed unprofessional conduct rather than inadequacy of classroom performance.\n\nThe District is not required to provide certificated teachers with the opportunity to overcome or remediate unprofessional conduct prior to initiating discipline or dismissal action, nor is the District required to provide any employee with remediation opportunities for conduct that otherwise constitutes unprofessional conduct and/or conduct in violation of the law or the District's policies, administrative regulations, or procedures.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nCopies of the observations, summative evaluations and performance classification of a certificated teacher are confidential, do not constitute a public record and shall not be released or shown to any person except as permitted by statute as follows:\n\n(a) To the certificated teacher.\n\n(b) To authorized District officers and employees for all personnel matters regarding employment and contracts and for any hearing that relates to personnel matters.\n\n(c) To school districts and charter schools that inquire about the performance of the teacher for prospective employment purposes. When the District receives evaluation information about a certificated teacher, the District's human resources department shall use this information solely for employment purposes and shall not release this information to or allow access to this information by any other person, entity, school district or charter school.\n\n(d) For introduction in evidence or discovery in any court action between the Board and the certificated teacher in which either: (a) the competency of the teacher is at issue or (b) the evaluation and performance classification were an exhibit at a hearing, the result of which is challenged.\n\nAppeal\n\nIf the evaluation of a certificated administrator, certificated psychologist or certificated teacher will be used as a criteria for establishing compensation, the employee may appeal an evaluation with which the employee disagrees by filing a notice of appeal with the qualified evaluator performing the evaluation within five (5) calendar days after receipt of the evaluation. The notice shall state why the employee disagrees with the evaluation. The appeal shall be reviewed by the supervisor of the qualified evaluator or designee. The reviewing supervisor may, but is not required, to meet with the employee. The reviewing supervisor shall issue a written decision on appeal within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the reviewing supervisor shall be final.\n\nNon-Certificated Administrators\n\nThe Board may establish a system to evaluate the performance of non-certificated administrators in the District that may result in at least one evaluation of each administrator by the administrator's supervisor or designee each school year.\n\nSupport Staff Evaluations\n\nThe Board may adopt or establish a system to evaluate the performance of support staff in the District that may result in at least one evaluation of each support staff employee by the employee's supervisor or designee each school year. Employees in the first year of employment shall be evaluated ninety (90) days after the first day of work."

    "content": "A. Certificated Employees\n\nThe termination of a certificated employee who is under contract for the major portion of the school year is governed by state law, including but not limited to A.R.S. § 15-538.01; A.R.S. § 15-538.02, A.R.S. § 15-539, A.R.S. § 15-541 and A.R.S. § 15-550.\n\nB. Support Staff and Non-Certificated Employees: At-Will Employees\n\nUnless the employee and the Governing Board sign a written agreement to the contrary, support staff and other non-certificated employees are employed at the will of the employee and the Board. This means that support staff and other non-certificated employees may resign without prior notice at any time for any reason or no reason. It also means that support staff and other non-certificated employees may be dismissed by the Board without prior notice at any time for any reason or no reason. No employee shall be dismissed for a legally impermissible reason (including but not limited to protected First Amendment expression, race, color, sex, religion, national origin, or disability).\n\nThe Superintendent is authorized to place support staff and other non-certificated employees on administrative leave with pay until the Board decides whether or not to dismiss the employee.\n\nNothing in this or any other District policy or document is intended to create any property or contract right to employment for any support staff or other non-certificated employee for any specific period of time. Except as set forth in a written agreement for employment for a specific time period, signed by the employee and the Board, any references in any District document or policy that includes specific time periods (such as \"hourly,\" or \"weekly,\" or \"annual\") or specific benchmarks are intended to be descriptive only, and do not constitute or evidence any agreement to employ any support staff or other non-certificated employee for such time.\n\nNo supervisor or other employee may modify any employee's at-will status, and any attempt to do so is void and of no effect. No employee should rely on any statement made by any person that is contrary to this Policy.\n\nUnless an at-will support staff or other non-certificated employee receives a notice of appointment for the succeeding school year, or is re-hired by action of the Board, the employee's employment shall automatically terminate at the end of the school year (for employees whose job duties are for the school year), or June 30 (for employees whose job duties are year round) with no action by the Board.\n\nC. Support Staff and Non-Certificated Employees: Term Employees\n\nA \"term employee\" is a support staff employee or non-certificated employee who is a party to a written employment agreement or contract signed by the employee and the Board that sets forth a specific term of employment (\"Term Employee\"). The term of a written employment agreement or contract of a Term Employee's employment may not exceed one fiscal year.\n\nUnless the Term Employee receives and signs a new written employment agreement for the succeeding school year, or is re-hired by action of the Board, the employee's employment shall automatically terminate at the end of the school year (for employees whose job duties are for the school year), or June 30 (for employees whose job duties are year round) with no action by the Board.\n\nA Term Employee may be terminated during the term of the employment agreement for good cause.\n\nIf the Superintendent determines that a Term Employee should be terminated during the term of the employment agreement, the Superintendent shall prepare a \"Notice of Recommended Termination\" (\"Notice\") and shall send it to the employee. The Notice may be hand-delivered, sent certified or first-class mail, or by electronic means. The Notice shall include at least the following:\n\nD. Hearing Process for Term Employees\n\nIf the Term Employee requests a hearing, the matter will be assigned to an independent hearing officer, appointed by the Board. The hearing officer shall hold the hearing no later than ten (10) work days after the hearing officer is appointed and shall provide the employee at least (5) work days' advance notice of the hearing date. The hearing shall be recorded.\n\nAt the hearing, the Superintendent bears the burden of proof to show that the Term Employee engaged in conduct that constitutes \"good cause\" for termination. The hearing shall be informal, without strict adherence to the rules of evidence. At the hearing, both the Superintendent and the Term Employee may call witnesses, may cross-examine the other's witnesses, and may introduce other relevant evidence. The Superintendent and the Term Employee may be represented by legal counsel. The Term Employee's legal counsel, if any, shall be at the employee's expense. If the Term Employee intends to be represented by legal counsel, the Term Employee must provide notice to the hearing officer and the Superintendent of such representation no less than three (3) work days prior to the date of the hearing.\n\nWithin ten (10) work days after the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue a written report to the Board. The report shall include findings of fact, conclusions (if warranted), and a recommendation. At the next available Board meeting, the Board shall consider the hearing officer's report and recommendations. The Board's review shall be based on the record before the hearing officer with no new evidence or argument being permitted.\n\nThe review shall occur in executive session unless the Term Employee demands that it occur in public session.\n\nThe Board shall either affirm, modify or reject the Superintendent's recommendation regarding the employee's dismissal. The decision of the Board shall occur in public meeting. The Board's decision is final.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1681"

For a member of the Reserve components of the Armed Forces, duty means during the deployment of the member with the Armed Forces to a foreign country under a federal call or order to active duty in support of a contingency operation, in accordance with 29 C.F.R. § 825.102.\n\n\"Covered service member\" is a current member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, who is receiving medical treatment, recuperation or therapy, or is in outpatient status or on the temporary disability retired list for a serious injury or illness.\n\n\"Instructional employees\" are those whose principal function is to teach and instruct students in a class, a small group, or an individual setting. This term includes not only teachers, but also athletic coaches, driving instructors, and special education assistants such as signers for the hearing impaired. It does not include teacher assistants or aides who do not have as their principal job actual teaching or instructing, auxiliary personnel such as counselors, psychologists, or curriculum specialists, cafeteria workers, maintenance workers, or bus drivers.\n\n\"Key employee\" is a salaried, FMLA-eligible employee who is among the highest paid ten percent (10%) of all the employees employed by the employer within seventy-five (75) miles of the employee's worksite.\n\n\"Next of kin of a covered service member\" is the nearest blood relative, other than the covered service member's spouse, parent or child in the following order of priority: blood relatives who have been granted legal custody of the service member by court decree or statutory provisions, brothers and sisters, grandparents, aunts and uncles, and first cousins, unless the covered service member has specifically designated in writing another blood relative as his or her nearest blood relative for purposes of military caregiver leave under the FMLA.\n\n\"Parent\" means a biological, adoptive, step or foster father or mother, or any other individual who stood in loco parentis to the employee when the employee was a child. This term does not include parents \"in-law.\"\n\n\"Qualifying exigency\" includes short-notice deployment, military events and activities, child care and school activities, financial and legal arrangements, counseling, rest and recuperation, post-deployment activities, and additional activities that arise out of active duty, provided that the employer and employee agree, including agreement on timing and duration of the leave.\n\n\"Serious health condition\" means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves inpatient care or continuing treatment by a health care provider. This can include conditions with short-term, chronic, long-term or permanent periods of incapacity.\n\n\"Serious injury or illness\" is one that is incurred by a service member in the line of duty on active duty that may cause the service member to be medically unfit to perform the duties of his or her office, grade, rank or rating. A serious injury or illness also includes injuries or illnesses that existed before the service member's active duty and that were aggravated by service in the line of duty on active duty.\n\n\"Spouse\" means a husband or wife as defined or recognized in the state where the individual was married and includes individuals in a common law or same-sex marriage. Spouse also includes a husband or wife in a marriage that was validly entered into outside of the United States, if the marriage could have been entered into in at least one state.\n\nTo be eligible for leave under this Procedure, employees must meet the following requirements:\n\nTo qualify as FMLA leave under this Procedure, the leave must be for one of the following reasons:\n\nAn eligible employee may take up to twelve (12) weeks of FMLA leave during any twelve (12) month period. The District will measure the twelve (12) month period as a rolling (12) month period measured backward from the date an employee uses any leave under this policy. Each time an employee takes leave, the District will compute the amount of FMLA leave the employee has taken in the last twelve (12) months and subtract it from the twelve (12) weeks of available leave, and the balance remaining is the amount the employee is entitled to take at that time.\n\nAn eligible employee can take up to twenty-six (26) weeks for the FMLA military caregiver leave during a single twelve (12)-month period. The single twelve (12) month period for military caregiver leave begins on the first day the employee takes leave for this reason and ends twelve (12) months later, regardless of the twelve (12) month period established by the District for other FMLA leave reasons.\n\nEligible spouses who both work for the District may only take a combined total of twelve (12) weeks of leave for the birth of a child, adoption or placement of a child in foster care, or to care for a parent (but not a parent \"in-law\") with a serious health condition. Both may only take a combined total of twenty-six (26) weeks of leave to care for a covered injured or ill service member (if each spouse is a parent, spouse, child or next of kin of the service member).\n\nEmployees may take FMLA leave in one consecutive block of time, may use the leave intermittently (take a day periodically when needed over the year) or, under certain circumstances, may use the leave to reduce the workweek or workday, resulting in a reduced hour schedule. In all cases, the leave may not exceed a total of twelve (12) workweeks (or twenty-six (26) workweeks to care for an injured or ill service member) in a twelve (12) month period.\n\nThe District may temporarily transfer an employee to an available alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits if the alternative position would better accommodate the intermittent or reduced schedule, in instances when leave for the employee or employee's family member is foreseeable and for planned medical treatment, including recovery from a serious health condition or to care for a child after birth or placement for adoption or foster care.\n\nFor the birth, adoption or foster care of a child, the District and the employee must mutually agree to the schedule before the employee may take the leave intermittently or work a reduced-hour schedule. Leave for birth, adoption or foster care of a child must be taken within one (1) year of the birth or placement of the child.\n\nWhen leave is needed for planned medical treatment, the employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule treatment so as not to unduly disrupt the District's operations.\n\nThe District may require instructional employees who request intermittent leave or a reduced leave schedule to take leave of a particular duration or to transfer temporarily to an alternative position as permitted under the FMLA. The District may require an instructional employee who requests leave at the end of an academic term to extend the leave.\n\nAll employees requesting FMLA leave must provide verbal or written notice of the need for leave to their supervisor, the department manager or human resources manager.\n\nWithin five (5) business days after the employee has provided this notice, the human resources manager will complete and provide the employee with a notice of eligibility and rights and request a medical certification or other supporting documentation as necessary.\n\nWithin five (5) business days after the employee has submitted the required certification or other documentation, the human resources manager will complete and provide the employee with a written response to the employee's request for FMLA leave.\n\nThe District will continue an employee's health benefits during the leave period at the same level and under the same conditions as if the employee was continuously at work.\n\nWhile on paid leave, the District will continue to make payroll deductions to collect the employee's share of insurance premiums.\n\nWhile on unpaid leave, the employee must continue to make this payment, either in person or by mail. The payment must be received in the accounting department by the 15th day of each month. If the payment is more than thirty (30) calendar days late, the employee's health care coverage may be dropped for the duration of the leave. The District will provide at least fifteen (15) calendar days' notification prior to the employee's loss of coverage.\n\nIf the employee chooses not to return to work for reasons other than a continued serious health condition of the employee or the employee's family member or a circumstance beyond the employee's control, the District may require the employee to reimburse the District for the amount it paid for the employee's health insurance premium during the leave period.\n\nIf the employee contributes to a life insurance or disability plan, the District will continue making payroll deductions while the employee is on paid leave.\n\nIf the employee contributes to a life insurance or disability plan and the employee is on unpaid leave, the employee may request continuation of such benefits and pay his or her portion of the premiums, or the District may elect to maintain such benefits during the leave and pay the employee's share of the premium payments. If the employee does not continue required payments, the District will discontinue coverage during the leave. If the District maintains coverage, the District may recover the costs incurred for paying the employee's share of any premiums, whether or not the employee returns to work.\n\nAn employee who takes FMLA leave may be asked to provide a fitness for duty clearance from a health care provider. This requirement will be included in the District's response to the FMLA request. Generally, an employee who takes FMLA leave will be able to return to the same position or a position with equivalent status, pay, benefits and other employment terms. The position will be the same or one that is virtually identical in terms of pay, benefits and working conditions. The District may choose to exempt certain key employees from this requirement and not return them to the same or similar position when doing so will cause substantial and grievous economic injury to business operations. Key employees will be given written notice at the time FMLA leave is requested of the employee's status as a key employee.\n\nAn employee who is taking FMLA leave because of the employee's own serious health condition or the serious health condition of a family member must use all accrued but unused paid leave prior to being eligible for unpaid leave, subject to applicable law and Board Policy. Sick or general leave may run concurrently with FMLA leave if the reason for the FMLA leave is covered by the District's established sick or general leave policy.\n\nLeave for the birth of a child and for an employee's serious health condition, including workers' compensation leave (to the extent that worker's compensation leave qualifies), will be designated as FMLA leave and will run concurrently with FMLA. The employee will be required to substitute all accrued but unused paid leave prior to being eligible for unpaid leave, subject to applicable law and Board Policy. An employee who is taking leave for the adoption or foster care of a child must use all accrued but unused paid leave prior to being eligible for unpaid leave, subject to applicable law and Board policy.\n\nAn employee who is using military FMLA leave for a qualifying exigency must use all accrued but unused paid leave prior to being eligible for unpaid leave, subject to applicable law and Board policy, prior to being eligible for unpaid leave. An employee using FMLA military caregiver leave must also all accrued but unused paid leave prior to being eligible for unpaid leave prior to being eligible for unpaid leave, subject to applicable law and Board policy.\n\nThe District may require an employee on FMLA leave to report periodically on the employee's status and intent to return to work.\n\nNo District employee shall interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of any right provided under FMLA. Employees may not discriminate against any individual for exercising any rights protected under FMLA."

Discretionary Leave Amount\n\nRegular full-time equivalent six tenths (0.6 FTE) certificated personnel and all full-time, thirty (30) hours or more, support staff personnel are eligible for four (4) days of discretionary leave per school year. Discretionary leave is prorated per date of hire.\n\nDiscretionary leave requires prior approval. No more than five percent (5%) of the staff members will be approved for discretionary leave on any given day.\n\nDiscretionary leave is not cumulative; therefore, an employee is not entitled to more than four (4) days.\n\nNon-regular employees of the District such as substitute teachers, temporary employees or those employees who are not issued work agreements, notices of appointments or contracts are not eligible to accrue discretionary leave.\n\nOne (1) day of discretionary leave is equivalent to an employee's regularly scheduled hours for the assigned position(s). Employees who work less than a full fiscal year or less than a full FTE in their position receive a proportional amount of general leave based on their start date or work status.\n\nIf an employee should not use any or all of the four (4) days of discretionary leave allowed during the fiscal year in which it is granted, the discretionary leave hours not used will convert to sick leave at the end of the fiscal year.\n\nB. Discretionary Leave Accrual\n\nEmployees shall be credited with their discretionary leave at the beginning of their work calendar or the fiscal year.\n\nC.

Matters specified below are specifically excluded and not grievable.\n\n\"Immediate supervisor\" means the individual who is responsible for evaluating the Grievant.\n\nExcluded Matters\n\nThe term \"Grievance\" does not include:\n\nProcedure for Filing and Processing Grievances\n\nTimeline: A Grievance must be initiated within fifteen (15) work days of the date the Grievant knew or should have known of the violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of the policy or procedure that is the basis for the Grievance.\n\nInformal Level\n\nThe Grievant shall initiate the Grievance by requesting an informal conference with the individual alleged to have violated, misinterpreted or misapplied the Policy or Procedure that directly and negatively affected the Grievant. In some cases, this will be the Grievant's immediate supervisor. In other cases, it will be a building administrator or a District-level administrator.\n\nIf the individual with whom the Grievance is initiated is not a building administrator or a District-level administrator, the individual with whom the Grievance is initiated shall report the initiation of the Grievance to the Superintendent.\n\nTo track the timeline, the Grievant should initiate the Grievance by means of a written request for the informal conference and shall specify that the request is to initiate a Grievance at the Informal Level.\n\nThe supervisor or administrator with whom the Grievance is initiated shall confer with the Grievant within ten (10) work days of receiving the request for the informal conference, and shall provide the Grievant with a written decision regarding the Grievance within ten (10) work days following the conference.\n\nFormal Level I\n\nIf the Grievant is dissatisfied with the written decision at the Informal Level, the Grievant may file a Formal Level I Grievance within five (5) work days of receiving the written response.\n\nThe Grievant also may file a Formal Level I Grievance if the supervisor or administrator with whom the Grievance was initiated either refuses to meet with the Grievant or fails to issue a written decision within (10) work days following the meeting.

The appeal shall be submitted to the Superintendent, directed to the Board. The appeal must include a copy of the Informal Level and Level I decisions, and any documentation submitted to the Superintendent for consideration at those levels.\n\nAt one of the next two regular meetings following the appeal, the Board shall review the appeal.

Any employee found to have so violated this Policy may be disciplined, up to and including termination.\n\nMaking A Disclosure\n\nAn employee who becomes aware of alleged wrongful conduct by the District or any of its agents is encouraged to make a disclosure to the Governing Board as soon as possible, but in any case must make the disclosure no later than three hundred sixty-five (365) days after becoming aware of the alleged wrongful conduct.\n\nTo allow the District an opportunity to investigate alleged wrongful conduct and to take necessary internal corrective action, employees are encouraged to report in writing a disclosure of alleged wrongful conduct to the Superintendent. If the allegations concern the Superintendent, the complainant may file with the Board President.\n\nInvestigation and Determination\n\nThe Superintendent may conduct an investigation into the allegations contained in the disclosure and may take necessary corrective action, as warranted.\n\nIn some instances, the District may determine that the employee's allegations contained in the disclosure do not meet the definition of disclosure under this Policy and that no investigation is warranted.

Procedures for Whistleblower External Hearing\n\nThe Governing Board shall use an outside hearing officer and a hearing process when a complainant who is dissatisfied with the decision on the complainant's whistleblower complaint review files a timely request for a whistleblower external hearing. The purpose of the hearing is to determine whether an adverse personnel action resulted from the complainant's disclosure. No other issues or determinations are authorized.\n\nA request for hearing must be made no later than ten (10) work days after receipt of the written decision on the whistleblower complaint and contain the following:\n\nNo later than fifteen (15) work days after receipt of a request for hearing, the Superintendent will determine whether the complainant qualifies for a hearing based on the following:\n\nIf the request qualifies for a hearing, the Superintendent will forward the request to an external hearing officer to conduct a whistleblower hearing.\n\nIf the request does not qualify for a whistleblower external hearing, the request will be returned to the complainant with written reason(s) for rejection. No later than ten (10) work days after receipt of the decision, the complainant may file a written appeal of the rejection to the Board. The Board will respond to the complainant in writing no later than twenty (20) work days after the Board reviews the written appeal. If the Board reverses the decision, the hearing will proceed; if the Board affirms the decision that the request does not qualify for a hearing, that decision is final.\n\nNo later than twenty (20) work days after receipt of the request for a hearing that qualifies for a hearing, the Superintendent shall notify the complainant that the request for hearing is accepted and provide contact information for the hearing officer. The hearing officer may, but is not required to, conduct a pre-hearing conference in person or by electronic means to discuss the procedures that will be followed in conducting the hearing, including submission of evidence, documents, and witness lists. The hearing officer may require the parties to submit summaries of their positions before the hearing commences.\n\nThe hearing will be conducted no later than sixty (60) work days after the request is received, unless the hearing officer extends the time for good cause.\n\nHearings shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements of A.R.S. § 41-783 governing appeals of personnel decisions. The procedures designated herein supersede rules of civil procedure if there is a conflict. The formal rules of evidence do not govern the hearing, except the rules of privilege. Generally, the party advocating a particular point or fact has the burden of proof on that point or fact. Ultimately, the person seeking review has the burden of persuading the hearing officer that the person was subject to an adverse employment action and the adverse action occurred because of a disclosure. The evidence standard is proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nThe hearing officer has the ability to issue subpoenas. The hearing shall either be recorded or transcribed, at District expense, so as to provide an accurate, written rendition of the hearing.\n\nA complainant may be self-represented, or at the complainant's own expense, may be represented by an attorney at any stage of the hearing process, including but not limited to presentation of the case during the hearing. A complainant may also designate a representative for the hearing who is not an attorney, provided that no fee is charged for any service rendered in connection with the hearing by a representative who is not an attorney admitted to practice in Arizona. The District may also be represented at the hearing by an attorney.\n\nAt any time, the parties may agree upon a resolution of the matter. In such event, the written agreement shall be presented to the Superintendent who shall close the case and notify the parties in writing that the matter is resolved by agreement.\n\nNo later than forty-five (45) work days after the close of the hearing, the hearing officer shall provide a written decision and shall transmit the decision to the complainant and Superintendent.\n\nThe decision will contain findings of fact and the evidence relied upon to sustain those facts, conclusions including reference to applicable law, rules or policies, and a decision by the hearing officer determining: (1) the validity of the complaint; and (2) whether the adverse personnel action was committed against the complainant as a result of a disclosure.\n\nThe hearing officer shall enter a decision to affirm, reverse, or modify the adverse employment action.\n\nThe hearing officer's decision following the hearing becomes the final District decision fourteen (14) work days after the complainant's receipt of that decision.\n\nThe hearing officer's decision is subject to judicial review under A.R.S. §12-901, et seq.\n\nThe hearing officer's decision following the hearing shall include a statement regarding the timelines for appeal (thirty-five (35) calendar days from receipt of the decision) to seek review of that decision in the superior court in accordance with the provisions of A.R.S. §12-901, et seq. on any of the grounds set forth in A.R.S. § 41-783(F)."

    "content": "A. Definitions\n\n\"Bilingual education/native language instruction\" means a language acquisition process for students in which much or all instruction, textbooks, or teaching materials are in the student's native language other than English.\n\n\"English language classroom\" means a classroom in which English is the language of instruction used by the teaching personnel, and in which such teaching personnel possess a good knowledge of the English language. English language classrooms encompass both English language mainstream classrooms and sheltered English immersion classrooms.\n\n\"English language mainstream classroom\" means a classroom in which the students either are native English language speakers or already have acquired reasonable fluency in English.\n\n\"English learner\" means a student who does not speak English or whose native language is not English, and who is not currently able to perform ordinary classroom work in English.\n\n\"Sheltered English immersion\" or \"structured English immersion\" means an English language acquisition process for young children in which nearly all classroom instruction is in English but with the curriculum and presentation designed for children who are learning the language. Books and instructional materials are in English and all reading, writing, and subject matter are taught in English. Although teachers may use a minimal amount of the child's native language, when necessary, no subject matter shall be taught in any language other than English, and children in this program learn to read and write solely in English. This educational methodology represents the standard definition of \"sheltered English,\" or \"structured English\" found in educational literature.\n\n\"Compensatory instruction\" is educational services, such as tutoring, after school classes or academic summer camps designed to assist students achieving academic standards.\n\n\"English language development\" means instruction designed specifically for English language learners to develop their listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills in English.\n\n\"Primary home language other than English\" means the language most spoken in the home, the language most spoken by the student, or the first acquired language.\n\nB. Sheltered English Immersion\n\nAll students who are English learners shall be educated through sheltered English immersion during a temporary transition period not normally intended to exceed one year. Once English learners have acquired a good working knowledge of English based on the state English proficiency assessment and are able to do regular schoolwork in English, they shall no longer be classified as English learners and shall not require the EL designated instructional minutes.\n\nC. Program\n\nEach school shall use research based Structured English Instruction (SEI) models developed and approved by the Arizona State Board of Education for their English Learner (EL) program. All ELs are to be provided with appropriate daily English language development and instruction that include a minimum of one hundred and twenty (120) minutes per day of English language development (ELD) for grades K-5, and a minimum of one hundred (100) minutes per day of ELD for grades 6-12. Additionally, approved instructional models must adhere to the following criteria:\n\nThe District's Language Acquisition Department or Superintendent will annually review the required EL program specifics with all instructional staff and provide aligned professional development.\n\nD. Student Identification\n\nA home language survey form will be completed at the time of enrollment of new or transfer students. If the primary home language is a language other than English, the student shall be considered to have a primary or home language other than English. The student will then be assessed using the state language proficiency assessment to determine English language proficiency. The timeline to test and notify parents/legal guardians of results is thirty (30) calendar days for those students who enroll at the beginning of the school year or within ten (10) school days of a student's enrollment in school after the first 30 calendar days of school.\n\nThose students who are determined not proficient using the state English language proficiency assessment upon initial entry shall be administered a state English language reassessment typically after February 1st to measure language growth and proficiency. New and continuing ELs may be assessed at the midpoint of the academic year, but no student may be assessed more than three times per year. The midyear assessment (not a wholesale assessment of all students) will provide those who warrant assessment an opportunity to enter a mainstream classroom as soon as possible.\n\nThe tests will be administered at the times indicated by trained personnel except when federal grants require different timelines or when an individualized education program (IEP) team finds the procedure inappropriate for a student who qualifies for exceptional student services.\n\nE. Student Progress and Reassessment for Reclassification\n\nAt least annually, parents/legal guardians shall receive a notice of overall student proficiency level, all four language domains and program placement through a copy of the language assessment report and teacher conference.\n\nELs not progressing as evidenced by failure to improve scores on the Arizona state standards tests or the nationally standardized test of A.R.S. § 15-741 may be provided compensatory instruction to assist them in achieving those standards. A written individualized compensatory plan that documents the scope and type of instructional services provided to an EL shall be kept in the student's file.\n\nReassessment of classification may take place following assessment testing but shall be considered at least once a year. If appropriate, parents/legal guardians shall receive a reclassification notice with a copy of the notice to be placed in the student EL file.\n\nWhen a student is reclassified as a fluent English language (FEL) student, the school shall monitor the student for two years after the reclassification to determine if the student is performing satisfactorily. Students will be monitored in reading, writing and mathematics skills and mastery of academic content areas. Assessment data of progress should be included in the two-year monitoring form. The form shall be maintained in the student's EL file.\n\nF. Bilingual Instruction/Native Language Instruction Exception\n\nIndividual schools in which twenty or more students of a given grade level receive parental exception waivers shall offer classes teaching English and other subjects through bilingual education techniques or other generally recognized educational methodologies permitted by law. Where the individual school is not required to offer these classes, students shall be permitted to transfer to a school in which such a class is offered.\n\nG. Prerequisites for Parental Exception Requests\n\nParents/legal guardians may apply annually for a waiver of the requirement that their student be placed in an English language classroom pursuant to A.R.S. § 15-752 by submitting prior written informed consent. In order to provide informed written consent a parents/legal guardians must:\n\nH. Parental Exception Waiver\n\nAfter meeting the above prerequisites, an application for waiver may be submitted if one of the following applies:\n\nI. Denial of Waiver\n\nAny request that does not meet the above requirements shall be denied. The reasoning behind the denial must be provided in writing to the parents/legal guardians.\n\nJ. Duration of Waiver\n\nAll waivers shall be effective for one year. Parents/legal guardians are permitted to submit waiver applications annually."

Admin. Code. R7-2-808(2)(b)(ii)) that includes the student's cumulative grade for the current grading period.\n\n\"Fiscal agent\" means the Executive Director of Finance (or similar position/title), or his or her designee.\n\nB. Cultural Accommodations\n\nExtracurricular activities shall be open to all eligible students. District personnel organizing extracurricular activities should ensure that rules related to the extracurricular activity do not interfere with the cultural traditions, including religious traditions, of potential participants. If rules related to an extracurricular activity would prohibit a student from participating because of the student's cultural traditions, the faculty sponsor shall implement alternative rules, schedules, or other aspects of the activity if doing so would not: (a) alter the fundamental purposes of the extracurricular activity; or (b) affect the health and safety of participants.\n\nIf an extracurricular activity's rules or schedule are governed by an outside association, the faculty sponsors of the extracurricular activity shall, in consultation with the affected student or students and their parent/legal guardian, take reasonable steps to request and obtain accommodations allowing students to participate.\n\nExtracurricular activities shall not require a student to remove a religious or cultural accessory or hairpiece if the accessory or hairpiece does not jeopardize the health or safety of the student or other participants in the activity, as determined by the supervisor or officiant of the activity.\n\nExamples of accommodations may include, but are not limited to, modifications to uniforms, jerseys, or other clothing associated with the activity or rearranging schedules to avoid conflicts with religious or cultural observances.\n\nC. Academic Contests\n\nAll travel and expenditures related to academic contests that are eligible for funding from the state academic contests fund must first be approved by the Board.\n\nThe fiscal agent is designated as an authorized representative of the District and is responsible for the disbursement of travel funds.\n\nAll requests for funds from the state academic contests fund should be directed to the fiscal agent. Before submitting requests for funding for academic contests, the contest advisor should first ensure that the contest is on the Arizona State Board of Education's list of approved contests and:\n\nAfter Board approval of participation in an academic contest, the Fiscal Agent shall apply to the Arizona State Board of Education for funding.\n\nNot more than thirty (30) days after the academic contest, the contest advisor shall submit a completion report to the fiscal agent. Not more than ninety (90) days after the academic contest, the fiscal agent will verify the accuracy of the completion report and submit the completion report, together with any unused funds, to the Arizona Department of Education.\n\nD. Interscholastic Extracurricular Activities\n\nStudents participating in any interscholastic extracurricular activity must meet both of the following criteria:\n\nIf a student does not meet the above criteria, the student shall be ineligible to participate in the activities until the criteria above are met.\n\nTeachers shall regularly assess students' progress toward earning a passing grade and, upon determining that a student is at risk for losing eligibility to participate in interscholastic extracurricular activities, shall immediately notify the student and the student's parent/legal guardian of pending ineligibility. Such notice shall be confidential and may be verbal or in writing. The teacher shall also notify the faculty sponsor for all interscholastic extracurricular activities in which the student participates. The teacher and faculty sponsor(s) then discuss appropriate educational support services that they may offer to encourage maintaining eligibility.\n\nIf, based on a student's most recent progress report, the principal determines that a student is ineligible to participate in the activities, the principal shall send written notice to the ineligible student, the student's parent/legal guardian, and the faculty sponsor for all applicable activities, of the student's ineligibility. The student shall receive support services designed to help the student meet eligibility requirements. The student shall remain ineligible, following the mandatory one-week sit period, until a subsequent check on eligibility is performed and the student meets eligibility requirements.\n\nThe teacher and faculty sponsor(s) should continue to provide appropriate educational support services after a determination of ineligibility.\n\nE. Passing Grades and Eligibility to Participate in Extracurricular Activities\n\nTo be eligible to participate in extracurricular activities, a student shall earn a passing grade in each course in which the student is enrolled and shall maintain satisfactory progress toward graduation. In order to maintain satisfactory progress toward graduation, it is required that a student have accumulated a minimum of five (5) credits at the conclusion of the second semester completed in regards to a six (6) period schedule, shall have accumulated a minimum of ten (10) credits at the conclusion of the fourth (4th) semester completed in regards to a six (6) period schedule, and shall have accumulated a minimum of sixteen (16) credits at the conclusion of the sixth (6th) semester completed in regards to a six (6) period schedule. If a student is not in line with this required academic progress, the student shall be ineligible until the student has met the academic progress requirements. The student may request a one-time waiver provided with an approved academic plan.\n\nThe Governing Board has established nine (9) weeks as the grading period for determining eligibility in regards to a six (6) period schedule.\n\nClarification: Eligibility\n\nThe regular grading period for determining eligibility shall be every nine (9) weeks in regards to a six (6) period schedule. It is on a cumulative basis from the beginning of instruction to the recording of a transcript grade.\n\nFor students who a teacher determines on three-week intervals in a nine-week grading period to be failing a class at the third week or sixth week of the nine-week period, the teacher shall notify the coach or sponsor advisor that the student is at risk of failing the course. For any such notice, the coach or sponsor advisor shall immediately meet with the student and the student's parent or guardian to discuss appropriate educational support services (defined below) to assist the student with academic success as a priority over interscholastic or extracurricular activity success. This preliminary notice of risk of failure at the third or sixth week of a nine-week grading period is not a notice of ineligibility from competitions. Ineligibility from competitions is determined at the end of the nine-week grading period. However, a student's failure to participate in a reasonable and appropriate plan for educational support services may result in ineligibility, suspension or dismissal from the team or activity.\n\nThe student must be maintaining satisfactory progress toward graduation. Incoming ninth (9th) graders who have graduated from eighth (8th) grade will be eligible for participation.\n\nClarification: Participation\n\nInterscholastic activities: Students who become ineligible at the end of any grading period may be permitted to attend and participate in practice sessions in order to maintain skill level and conditioning but shall not be permitted to participate in team or group competition or in any activity in which judging of the team/group function occurs.\n\nOther activities: A student who becomes ineligible at the end of any grading period may attend any activity, meeting, or function sponsored by the club or organization from which the student has been declared ineligible but may not participate until having met eligibility requirements.\n\nNotice of Ineligibility\n\nThe District shall provide a preliminary written and/or oral notice to all students and parents of pending ineligibility, as well as written and/or oral notice of ineligibility at the end of the District grading period.\n\nClarification:\n\nIneligibility Schedule\n\nA student who has been declared ineligible at a periodic grading period review shall remain ineligible until the student has been determined to be eligible pursuant to District policies and A.A.C. R7-2-808.\n\nF. Progress toward Promotion or Graduation\n\nA student shall be deemed to be maintaining satisfactory progress toward promotion or graduation if a student has accumulated a minimum of five (5) credits at the conclusion of the second semester completed in regards to a six (6) period schedule, has accumulated a minimum of ten (10) credits at the conclusion of the fourth (4th) semester completed in regards to a six (6) period schedule, and has accumulated a minimum of sixteen (16) credits at the conclusion of the sixth (6th) semester completed in regards to a six (6) period schedule. If a student is not in line with this required academic progress, the student shall be ineligible until the student has met the academic progress requirements. The student may request a one-time waiver provided with an approved academic plan. Students enrolled in online credit recovery courses must also maintain adequate progress in completion of the course.\n\nG. Students with Disabilities\n\nThe District shall adhere to the requirements of federal and state laws to provide students with disabilities access to its District-sponsored activities.\n\nH. Homeschooled Students\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, children who reside within the attendance area of any school in the District shall be permitted to participate in interscholastic extracurricular activities on the same basis as District students.\n\nBefore permitting a homeschooled student to participate in such activities, District personnel shall verify that the student lives within the attendance boundaries of the school, and the individual providing primary instruction for the homeschooled student shall submit written verification of eligibility requirements on the same schedule as District students.\n\nHomeschooled students participating in interscholastic extracurricular activities must meet all applicable participation and eligibility requirements, including:\n\nA homeschooled student who was previously enrolled in a public, private, or charter school is ineligible to participate in interscholastic extracurricular activities for the remainder of the school year in which the student was enrolled in a school.\n\nThe District shall not contract with any private entity that supervises interscholastic activities if the private entity prohibits the participation of homeschooled students in interscholastic extracurricular activities at public, private or charter schools.\n\nI. Interscholastic Athletic Activities\n\nPolicy 5-410 contains additional information regarding interscholastic athletic activities."

Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the parent/legal guardian or eligible student when notified of the right to a hearing.\n\nOne exception that permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests.\n\nA \"school official\" includes a person employed by the District as an administrator, supervisor, instructor, or support staff member (including health or medical staff and law enforcement unit personnel) or a person serving on the Board. A school official also includes a volunteer, contractor, or consultant who, while not employed by the District, performs an institutional service or function for which the District would otherwise use its own employees and who is under the direct control of the District with respect to the use and maintenance of PII from education records, such as an attorney, auditor, medical consultant, or therapist; a parent/legal guardian or student volunteering to serve on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee; or a parent/legal guardian, student, or other volunteer assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks.\n\nA school official has a \"legitimate educational interest\" if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility.\n\nUpon request, the District discloses education records without consent to officials of another school or school district in which a student seeks or intends to enroll or is already enrolled if the disclosure is for purposes of the student's enrollment or transfer.\n\nContact information for filing a complaint can be found in Policy 5-303.\n\nA parent/legal guardian or eligible student may also file a complaint with the principal or the Superintendent. If the matter is not satisfactorily resolved by the principal or the Superintendent within sixty (60) days after the notice, the person may file a complaint with the Superintendent of Public Instruction.\n\nFERPA permits the disclosure of PII from students' education records without consent of the parent/legal guardian or eligible student if the disclosure meets certain conditions found in 34 C.F.R. § 99.31 of the FERPA regulations. Except for disclosures to school officials, disclosures related to some judicial orders or lawfully issued subpoenas, disclosures of directory information, and disclosures to the parent/legal guardian or eligible student, 34 C.F.R. § 99.32 of the FERPA regulations requires the District to record the disclosure. A parent/legal guardian and eligible student have a right to inspect and review the record of disclosures. The District may disclose PII from the education records of a student without obtaining prior written consent of the parent/legal guardian or the eligible student -"
